# Enhancement Tasks for Logger Module

## Functionality Enhancement

- [x] Enable the configuration of logger instances from an external configuration file.
- [x] Add support for additional logging levels (e.g., verbose).
- [x] Add support for structured logging (e.g., JSON format).

## Future Dev

- [->] Ensure compatibility with popular application frameworks (Express, Koa, Hapi, etc.).
- [->] Build integration for reporting logs to external monitoring services.
- [->] Develop features for log analysis or visualization. [Grafana]
- [->] Implement a logging queue system to handle high volume logging scenarios.
- [->] Develop a system for exporting logs to an external storage system (like cloud storage).
- [->] Create a system for exporting logs in different formats (JSON, CSV, etc.).
- [->] Include a system for changing configurations at runtime.
- [->] Develop a system for log data encryption for sensitive logs.
- [->] Create features for compliance with specific standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- [->] Implement log anonymization techniques for privacy concerns.
