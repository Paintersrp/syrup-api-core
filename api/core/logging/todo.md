# Logger Class Development

## **Core Features**

#### Complete

- [x] Implement Singleton design pattern for the centralized logger.
- [x] Configure different loggers with varying configurations.
- [x] Custom log levels are defined and used in the logger.

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Create utility methods for common logging tasks, like success and notice events.

## **Advanced Features**

#### Complete

- [x] Implement custom log levels.
- [x] Include more methods for usability and advanced of the class.

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Include a method to temporarily silence all logs.
- [ ] Implement a feature to archive old logs.
- [ ] Create a system for tagging logs.
- [ ] Include methods to write logs in batch.
- [ ] Build a mechanism to rotate logs based on size or time.

## **Configuration and Flexibility**

#### Complete

- [x] Provide a system for each logger to maintain the default stream and file specifications.
- [x] Include a system for overriding default configurations.

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Include a system for changing configurations at runtime.
- [ ] Implement a feature for loading configuration from external files or environment variables.
- [ ] Create a fallback system when the logging destination is not available.

## **Test Coverage**

#### Complete

- [ ]

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Test logging output for each logger.
- [ ] Test custom log levels and formats.
- [ ] Test utility methods.
- [ ] Test logger methods for edge cases.
- [ ] Create performance tests to ensure the logger doesn't affect application performance.
- [ ] Test the logger under different environments (OS, Node.js version, etc.).
- [ ] Test the archival and rotation systems.

## **Documentation and Code Quality**

#### Complete

- [x] Use TypeScript and provide type documentation.

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Document the usage and configuration of each logger.
- [ ] Provide examples of how to use each logger and utility method.
- [ ] Document how to add and use custom log levels and formats.
- [ ] Include usage examples in different application scenarios.
- [ ] Create an easy-to-follow guide for setting up the logger in a new project.
- [ ] Provide a guideline for contributing to the logger codebase.

## **Integration and Compatibility**

#### Complete

- [ ]

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Ensure compatibility with popular application frameworks (Express, Koa, Hapi, etc.).
- [ ] Build integration for reporting logs to external monitoring services.
- [ ] Create a system for exporting logs in different formats (JSON, CSV, etc.).

This updated list should be even more exhaustive and give you a clearer roadmap for the development of your advanced logger class.
