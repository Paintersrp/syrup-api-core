## TODO LIST:

### SyError Class Enhancements:

- [ ] Implement more specific error classes for detailed HTTP status codes, e.g. 429 Too Many Requests.
- [ ] Improve error categorization, splitting errors into logical groups (e.g., ClientErrors, ServerErrors, NetworkErrors).
- [ ] Provide internationalization support for error messages.
- [ ] Implement error throttling to prevent excessive logging under high load.
- [ ] Support wrapping of third-party errors to maintain consistent error handling across the system.
- [ ] Add a feature to support logging of non-exceptional events (warnings, information, etc.).
- [ ] Provide hooks to allow application code to define custom error handling logic.

### Error Reporting and Monitoring:

- [ ] Integrate with external monitoring services (e.g., New Relic, Datadog).
- [ ] Support structured logging for better integration with log management tools (e.g., Elasticsearch).
- [ ] Implement features to alert the dev team about critical or recurrent errors.
- [ ] Provide options to report different error types to different channels (e.g., Slack, Email, SMS).
- [ ] Implement a feature for automatic error ticket creation in issue tracking systems (e.g., Jira).
- [ ] Support generation of detailed error analytics reports.

### Error Traceability and Debugging:

- [ ] Improve the internal error code system, providing a unique code for each error type.
- [ ] Implement request-scoped error logging to group all errors related to a single request.
- [ ] Capture and log more contextual information (environment, request data, user data, etc.) for better debugging.
- [ ] Implement a correlation ID system for distributed tracing in microservices architecture.

### Test Coverage:

- [ ] Increase unit and integration test coverage to include all error types and scenarios.
- [ ] Implement error injection testing to ensure the system can handle errors gracefully.
- [ ] Add performance testing for error handling under high load.
- [ ] Implement tests for all integrations (monitoring services, log management tools, etc.).

### Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Improve code comments, providing more detailed descriptions for classes and methods.
- [ ] Follow consistent coding standards and conventions throughout the error handling code.
- [ ] Update the README.md with advanced usage examples, including integrations and customizations.
- [ ] Provide detailed API documentation, covering all error types and their respective internal codes.
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides for common errors and their resolution.
- [ ] Provide a detailed changelog for tracking changes and improvements to the error handling system.
