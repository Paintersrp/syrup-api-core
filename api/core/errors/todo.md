# TODO LIST

## **SyError Class Enhancements**

#### Complete

- [x] Improve error categorization, splitting errors into logical groups (e.g., ClientErrors, ServerErrors, NetworkErrors).
- [x] Implement error throttling to prevent excessive logging under high load.
- [x] Add a feature to support logging of non-exceptional events (warnings, information, etc.).
- [x] Implement more specific error classes for detailed HTTP status codes, e.g. 429 Too Many Requests.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Provide internationalization support for error messages.
- [->] Support wrapping of third-party errors to maintain consistent error handling across the system.
- [->] Add support for automatic client-side error reporting.

- [!!!] Implement all thrown errors as SyErrors

## **Error Reporting and Monitoring**

#### Complete

- [x] Support structured logging for better integration with log management tools (e.g., Elasticsearch).
- [x] Add support for tracking error frequency and patterns.
- [x] Support generation of detailed error analytics reports.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Integrate with external monitoring services (e.g., New Relic, Datadog).
- [->] Implement features to alert the dev team about critical or recurrent errors.
- [->] Provide options to report different error types to different channels (e.g., Slack, Email, SMS).
- [->] Implement a feature for automatic error ticket creation in issue tracking systems (e.g., Jira).
- [->] Implement a real-time error dashboard.

## **Error Traceability and Debugging**

#### Complete

- [x] Capture and log more contextual information (environment, request data, user data, etc.) for better debugging.
- [x] Improve the internal error code system, providing a unique code for each error type.
- [x] Implement request-scoped error logging to group all errors related to a single request.
- [x] Implement a correlation ID system for distributed tracing in microservices architecture.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Improve stack trace readability.

## **Test Coverage**

#### Complete

- [ ]

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Increase unit and integration test coverage to include all error types and scenarios.
- [ ] Implement error injection testing to ensure the system can handle errors gracefully.
- [ ] Add performance testing for error handling under high load.
- [ ] Implement tests for all integrations (monitoring services, log management tools, etc.).
- [ ] Create a suite of end-to-end tests focusing on error scenarios.

## **Documentation and Code Quality**

#### Complete

- [x] Provide detailed API documentation, covering all error types and their respective internal codes.
- [x] Add code comments and JSDoc for all error classes and methods.
- [x] Create a document explaining the error handling strategy and flow.
- [x] Improve code quality and maintainability, following best practices and design patterns.

#### Incomplete
