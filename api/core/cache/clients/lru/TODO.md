# TODO List

## SyLRUCache<T> Class

- [ ] Develop a sliding window-based mechanism for adjusting `defaultTTL` based on cache usage patterns.
- [ ] Implement bulk eviction for `autoEvictExpiredItems()` using a priority queue to improve performance.
- [ ] Optimize `evictLRUItem()` by maintaining a heap structure, reducing the time complexity.
- [ ] Add a `peek()` function to inspect cache items without changing their last accessed status in LRU.
- [ ] Develop a pausable/resumable eviction mechanism for expired items.
- [ ] Introduce detailed logging including cache hits, inserts, and size changes besides just misses and evictions.
- [ ] In the `set()` operation, consider cache size limit and throw meaningful errors or warnings when it's reached.
- [ ] Develop mechanisms for data persistence (to disk, Redis, etc.) and cache preloading at startup.
- [ ] Implement cache stampede prevention mechanisms, possibly using a queuing system or locks.
- [ ] Extend the class to support custom serializer/deserializer functions to handle complex data types.
- [ ] Introduce a memory-based limitation strategy besides the existing item count-based limitation.
- [ ] Develop an optional compression mechanism to reduce the memory footprint of the cache.

## CacheInterface<T> and SyCacheOptions

- [ ] Introduce per-item TTL configuration support, overriding the global TTL.
- [ ] Develop an interface to allow users to define custom eviction policies, adding more flexibility.
- [ ] Allow users to provide custom serialization/deserialization methods via `SyCacheOptions`.

## Eviction Mechanism

- [ ] Implement an optimized eviction mechanism by reducing the need for full cache traversal.
- [ ] Introduce an adaptive eviction strategy considering multiple factors (like hit count, TTL).
- [ ] Develop a system to dynamically adjust the eviction interval based on cache size and load.

## Test Coverage

- [ ] Write unit tests for all public and private methods in the SyLRUCache class.
- [ ] Develop test cases for edge scenarios, such as invalid inputs, cache overflows, and exceptional cases.
- [ ] Conduct load and stress testing to evaluate cache performance and stability under high load.
- [ ] Test the cache persistence and recovery behavior during system shutdown and startup.
- [ ] Use mock dependencies for database and logger during unit testing, isolating the cache behavior.

## Documentation and Code Quality

- [ ] Enhance inline comments to cover all important code sections and logic.
- [ ] Document all classes, methods, interfaces with comprehensive JSDoc comments.
- [ ] Refactor the code for readability, maintainability, and better separation of concerns.
- [ ] Create a comprehensive README.md with clear usage examples, API documentation, and performance considerations.
- [ ] Ensure the code adheres to a specific coding standard or style guide.

## Additional Features

- [ ] Introduce support for wildcard keys, allowing for more flexible get, set, and delete operations.
- [ ] Develop a system to allow for data versioning, useful in certain caching scenarios.
- [ ] Add functionality to support a distributed caching system, allowing for cache use across multiple nodes.
