# TODO LIST:

#

## DoublyLinkedList Class:

- [x] Implement methods for inserting at tail and removing from head.

#

## LinkedList Interface and Options:

- [x] Implement different iterator patterns for list traversal.
- [x] Implement serialization/deserialization methods to enable data persistence.

#

## Optimizations:

#

## Security:

#

## Test Coverage:

- [ ] Add test cases for each public method in DoublyLinkedList class.
- [ ] Add test cases for invalid inputs and error handling.
- [ ] Test list behavior under high load.
- [ ] Create performance tests for large linked lists.
- [ ] Mock dependencies for unit testing.

#

## Documentation and Code Quality:

#

## Additional Features:

- [x] Implement an event system to subscribe to list changes.

#

## **Deployment**

- [->] Create an interface to ensure consistency across different types of linked lists (e.g. singly, doubly, circular).
- [->] Allow easy switching between different types of linked lists using the Strategy design pattern.

- [->] Implement methods to handle sensitive data securely.
