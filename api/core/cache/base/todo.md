# TODO LIST

## SyBaseCache<T> Class

- [ ] Implement alternative caching policies such as MRU (Most Recently Used), ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache), and SLRU (Segmented LRU).
- [ ] Add a method for warm-up where commonly used data is preloaded into cache upon initialization.
- [ ] Implement a feature to replicate cache data across multiple nodes for improved availability.
- [ ] Enhance cache logging to include hit/miss ratio, cache growth rate, and cache eviction rate for better monitoring.
- [ ] Implement a configurable threshold for cache memory usage.
- [ ] Add an interface to expose cache state for external monitoring tools.
- [ ] Implement a fallback mechanism for handling cache failures without impacting the main application.
- [ ] Add a feature to handle hot keys scenario where multiple requests for a missing key arrive at the same time.
- [ ] Provide integration with popular application performance management tools (e.g. Datadog, New Relic).
- [ ] Support custom serialization and deserialization methods for complex or custom data types.
- [ ] Allow for different compression algorithms (e.g. Gzip, Brotli) to be chosen based on the nature of data.
- [ ] Provide the option to persist cache data to remote stores (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).

## CacheInterface and CacheStats

- [ ] Implement a feature to configure cache behavior on a per-item basis, such as TTL and eviction policy.
- [ ] Add a mechanism to track cache usage patterns over time and dynamically adjust cache policies.

## Auto-evicting Mechanism

- [ ] Implement priority queue-based eviction to improve efficiency.
- [ ] Consider cache item's size when implementing eviction policy, prioritizing larger items for eviction.
- [ ] Make auto-eviction interval dynamically adjustable based on system load and cache usage patterns.

## Test Coverage

- [ ] Implement stress tests and load tests to simulate high traffic scenarios.
- [ ] Add performance benchmark tests comparing different caching policies and eviction strategies.
- [ ] Create tests for failover scenarios and data integrity after cache recovery.
- [ ] Mock and test interactions with external systems (database, logger, etc.)

## Documentation and Code Quality

- [ ] Add detailed explanation for each method and its parameters using JSDoc comments.
- [ ] Improve code readability by adhering to a particular coding style or standard (like Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide).
- [ ] Implement static code analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube) for maintaining code quality.
- [ ] Create a comprehensive README with detailed API documentation, usage examples, caching strategies, and benchmarks.
- [ ] Update codebase to use latest JavaScript/TypeScript features for better performance and readability.
- [ ] Document strategies for diagnosing and troubleshooting common issues with the cache.
