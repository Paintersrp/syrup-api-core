# TODO LIST:

## ListItem<T> Class:

- [ ] Implement methods to manipulate ListItem (insert, delete, update, get)
- [ ] Add error handling for missing key, value, or frequency
- [ ] Include methods to check if ListItem is expired
- [ ] Include a method to renew ListItem expiration time if TTL was initially provided
- [ ] Implement methods for serialization and deserialization of ListItem
- [ ] Implement a method to print ListItem for debugging purposes
- [ ] Consider making ListItem a generic class to handle more types of keys/values
- [ ] Implement copy and clone methods for ListItem
- [ ] Create an "equals" method to compare two ListItems for equality

## ListItem Class Features and Options:

- [ ] Implement custom handlers for ListItem manipulation (insertion, deletion, updating)
- [ ] Include an option to enable/disable ListItem expiration (global or per item)
- [ ] Add support for custom key-value pairs in ListItem beyond just numbers
- [ ] Create method for automatic generation of keys if not provided
- [ ] Provide event hooks (events on insert, delete, update)
- [ ] Enable batch operations for creating multiple ListItems
- [ ] Create functionality for item dependencies (linked items)

## ListItem Links and Navigation:

- [ ] Optimize traversal of linked ListItems (next, previous)
- [ ] Implement a method to find ListItem based on key, value, or frequency
- [ ] Create a mechanism to maintain sorted order of ListItems based on a specific property (like frequency)
- [ ] Build functionality to reverse the order of linked ListItems
- [ ] Implement a method to split linked ListItems into separate lists

## Performance and Scalability:

- [ ] Optimize ListItem for large scale usage
- [ ] Implement caching for commonly accessed ListItems
- [ ] Measure and optimize memory usage of ListItem

## Test Coverage:

- [ ] Add test cases for each public method in ListItem class
- [ ] Add test cases for error handling and edge cases (invalid inputs, etc.)
- [ ] Test ListItem behavior under high load
- [ ] Test ListItem behavior during system shutdown
- [ ] Mock dependencies for unit testing
- [ ] Create integration tests to ensure ListItem works well with other components
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks and include performance testing

## Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Improve inline comments for all methods and properties
- [ ] Add jsdoc style comments for the ListItem class and its methods
- [ ] Refactor code for better readability and maintainability
- [ ] Implement code linter and formatter for consistent coding style
- [ ] Create a README.md with usage examples and API documentation
- [ ] Include type definitions for better IntelliSense in IDEs
