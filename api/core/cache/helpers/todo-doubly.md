## TODO LIST:

### DoublyLinkedList Class:

- [ ] Implement methods for inserting at tail and removing from head.
- [ ] Add method to search for a particular node.
- [ ] Include functionality to reverse the linked list.
- [ ] Implement a method to find the middle of the list.
- [ ] Add functionality to detect and remove cycles in the list.
- [ ] Implement a method to sort the linked list.
- [ ] Include method to merge two sorted linked lists.
- [ ] Add optional logging for all list operations.
- [ ] Implement safety checks and error handling for edge cases.
- [ ] Provide a way to clone/copy a linked list.
- [ ] Implement additional methods for linked list comparisons (e.g. check if two lists are equal).
- [ ] Add functionality for node swapping.
- [ ] Implement partition operation (useful for sorting algorithms).
- [ ] Add functionality to rotate list by N nodes.
- [ ] Implement methods for adding a node at a specific position in the list.

### LinkedList Interface and Options:

- [ ] Create an interface to ensure consistency across different types of linked lists (e.g. singly, doubly, circular).
- [ ] Allow easy switching between different types of linked lists using the Strategy design pattern.
- [ ] Implement different iterator patterns for list traversal.
- [ ] Implement serialization/deserialization methods to enable data persistence.

### Optimizations:

- [ ] Implement a more efficient search mechanism (e.g., Skip List).
- [ ] Optimize memory usage by using a more efficient data structure for nodes.
- [ ] Implement Lazy loading and write-back for large linked list data.

### Security:

- [ ] Secure the list contents using encryption.
- [ ] Implement methods to handle sensitive data securely.

### Test Coverage:

- [ ] Add test cases for each public method in DoublyLinkedList class.
- [ ] Add test cases for invalid inputs and error handling.
- [ ] Test list behavior under high load.
- [ ] Create performance tests for large linked lists.
- [ ] Mock dependencies for unit testing.

### Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Improve inline comments for all methods.
- [ ] Add TypeScript doc style comments for all classes, methods, and interfaces.
- [ ] Refactor code for better readability and maintainability.
- [ ] Follow a consistent code style guide.
- [ ] Create a README.md with usage examples, API documentation and contribution guidelines.
- [ ] Set up continuous integration for automated testing.

### Additional Features:

- [ ] Consider using decorator patterns for additional list features.
- [ ] Implement an event system to subscribe to list changes.
