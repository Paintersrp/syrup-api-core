## TODO LIST:

### SyServer Class Enhancements:

- [ ] Add a load balancing mechanism to distribute network traffic efficiently across multiple servers.
- [ ] Implement automatic service discovery to easily add or remove services in a microservices architecture.
- [ ] Incorporate session management to track user interaction with the server.
- [ ] Introduce an option for horizontal scaling for handling increased load.
- [ ] Develop a system for traffic shaping, prioritizing certain types of requests.
- [ ] Integrate an API Gateway functionality to route requests to appropriate microservices.
- [ ] Incorporate support for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocols for improved performance.
- [ ] Add support for server push and service workers for more interactive applications.
- [ ] Create functionality to regularly update server certificates for improved security.
- [ ] Implement an integrated Content Delivery Network (CDN) support for faster content delivery.

### Server Interface and Options:

- [ x ] Enable hot-reloading for changes in the server configuration without restarting the server.
- [ ] Provide support for internationalization and localization.
- [ ] Allow adding custom health check methods to the SyHealthMixin.
- [ ] Add options for configuring server timeouts (e.g., keep-alive, read, write).
- [ ] Implement server-side rendering support for frontend frameworks (like React, Vue, Angular).

### Graceful Shutdown and Error Recovery Mechanisms:

- [ ] Introduce a failover mechanism to redirect traffic if the server fails.
- [ ] Add auto-recovery system to recover from crashes and fatal errors.
- [ ] Implement more advanced resource cleanup during graceful shutdown.
- [ ] Design an efficient system for logging, tracking, and handling server errors.

### Test Coverage:

- [ ] Perform stress testing and optimize the server for maximum concurrent requests.
- [ ] Implement tests to verify the resilience and recovery of the server after crashes.
- [ ] Test for potential memory leaks under heavy server load.
- [ ] Test server behavior under different network conditions and latencies.
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for full server functionality.

### Documentation, Code Quality, and DevOps:

- [ ] Create an interactive API documentation using tools like Swagger.
- [ ] Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- [ ] Add Docker support for containerized deployment of the server.
- [ ] Perform code auditing for potential security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Automate routine tasks using scripts or tools like npm scripts, Grunt, or Gulp.
