# TODO LIST

## SyServer Class

- [ ] Implement mechanism to automatically handle middleware dependencies (e.g., session middleware before auth middleware)
- [ ] Add a server-level validation schema for all incoming requests
- [ ] Allow different logging levels for different environments (e.g., verbose in development, errors only in production)
- [ ] Include built-in rate limiting to protect against abuse
- [ ] Add support for server-side events, allowing users to hook into these events
- [ ] Implement a way to add custom signal handling (e.g., SIGHUP for config reload)
- [ ] Implement SSL/TLS support for secure communication
- [ ] Add support for WebSockets, in addition to traditional HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- [ ] Create a feature for server clustering to better utilize multi-core systems
- [ ] Add support for CORS configuration and middleware
- [ ] Allow configuration for server-side request and response caching
- [ ] Include support for middleware that provides request/response compression

## Server Interface and Options

- [ ] Add more options for configuring the server's logger
- [ ] Allow defining custom request and response decorators
- [ ] Implement a pluggable authentication/authorization interface for securing endpoints
- [ ] Extend options to support custom server initialization, beyond what's provided in constructor

## Graceful Shutdown Mechanism

- [ ] Improve the graceful shutdown mechanism to handle more complex scenarios (e.g., long-running requests)
- [ ] Add support for draining incoming connections before stopping the server

## Test Coverage

- [ ] Write test cases for all public methods in SyServer class
- [ ] Add tests for error conditions, edge cases, and unusual inputs
- [ ] Test server behavior under high load and high concurrency
- [ ] Verify graceful shutdown behavior in various scenarios
- [ ] Mock dependencies like database, cache, and logger for unit testing

## Documentation and Code Quality

- [ ] Improve inline comments for all methods
- [ ] Add JSDoc style comments for all classes, methods, and interfaces
- [ ] Refactor code for better modularity and readability
- [ ] Update README.md with usage examples, API documentation, and best practices for using SyServer
