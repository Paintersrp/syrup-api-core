- [x] Create APIs for programmatically managing the server.
- [x] Allow adding custom health check methods to the SyHealthMixin.
  - HealthCheckMixin
- [x] Add options for configuring server timeouts (e.g., keep-alive, read, write).
  - Handled by Middleware Globally

#### Incomplete

- [->] Provide support for internationalization and localization.
- [->] Introduce an integrated dashboard for real-time monitoring of server status.
- [->] Support for serverless architecture.

#

## **Graceful Shutdown and Error Recovery Mechanisms:**

#### Complete

- [x] Implement more advanced resource cleanup during graceful shutdown.
- [x] Design an efficient system for logging, tracking, and handling server errors.
- [x] Design a backup and restore system for disaster recovery.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Introduce a failover mechanism to redirect traffic if the server fails.
- [->] Add auto-recovery system to recover from crashes and fatal errors. [PM2 in Deployment]
- [ ] Restart Command / Endpoint

#

## **Test Coverage:**

#### Complete

- [x] Implement basic unit tests for the core functionality of the server.

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Perform stress testing and optimize the server for maximum concurrent requests.
- [ ] Implement tests to verify the resilience and recovery of the server after crashes.
- [ ] Test for potential memory leaks under heavy server load.
- [ ] Test server behavior under different network conditions and latencies.
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for full server functionality.
- [ ] Implement automatic testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
