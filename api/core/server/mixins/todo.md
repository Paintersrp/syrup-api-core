# SyHealthMixin Class Development:

## **Core Features**

#### Complete

- [x] Implement a custom Domain Specific Language (DSL) for defining complex health checks, supporting advanced check strategies and dependencies.

#### Incomplete

#

## **Advanced Features**

#### Complete

- [x] Create automated remediation scripts that can automatically respond to common failure scenarios, potentially fixing issues before they impact the system.
- [x] Add a mechanism to perform "deep" health checks that include dependent services, tracing issues to their source and allowing for comprehensive system checks.
- [x] Create a maintenance mode feature, allowing for planned downtime without false alarms.
- [x] Implement a feature to ignore specific health checks during scheduled maintenance.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Develop a health check chaining system, allowing for dependencies between checks where the output of one check can be used as the input for another.checks.

#

## **Notifications and Reporting**

#### Complete

- [x] Allow for health checks to be triggered manually, not just at predefined intervals, providing flexibility in system maintenance and monitoring.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Add an option for sending health status reports to a specified email, allowing stakeholders to keep track of system health without needing to check the dashboard.
- [->] Develop SMS and push notifications alerts for real-time, critical failure notifications.

#

## **Health Check Interface and Options**

#### Complete

- [x] Add user permissions and authentication for health check access and control.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Implement a system for scheduling health checks at different intervals based on their importance and load, reducing system stress.

#

## **Monitoring and Logging**

#### Complete

- [x] Add support for anomaly detection in health check results, improving the detection of potential issues.

#### Incomplete

#

## **Documentation and Code Quality**

#### Complete

- [x] Create detailed technical documentation explaining the architecture of the health check system, improving onboarding and development speed.
- [x] Develop a style guide for writing health checks, improving code consistency and maintainability. (with Check Classes)

#### Incomplete

- [->] Provide code examples for common health check scenarios.

#

## **Test Coverage**

#### Complete

- [ ]

#### Incomplete

- [->] Add performance tests to simulate high load on health check endpoints, ensuring the system can handle real-world conditions.
- [->] Implement a chaos engineering system for testing the resilience of health checks, increasing the robustness of the system.
- [->] Test for resilience against common network issues (latency, packet loss, etc.), ensuring that the system can cope with less-than-ideal conditions.
- [->] Test for proper functioning in different runtime environments (OS, Node.js version), ensuring compatibility and stability.

#

## **Deployment**

- [->] Develop a graphical dashboard for real-time health monitoring of services, showing a visual representation of system status and health check results.
  - [->] Add multi-language support for the graphical dashboard.

- [->] Add support for WebSocket-based health checks to allow for real-time updates without constant polling.

- [->] Integrate with popular cloud-based monitoring services (like AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring) to deliver status reports to a centralized monitoring solution.
- [->] Implement a load balancing mechanism to distribute health check requests, reducing potential stress on individual services.

- [->] Add support for distributed tracing, improving the debugging process in a microservices architecture. [Opentelemetry]

- [->] Allow real-time streaming of health check logs, improving live monitoring capabilities.
- [->] Build an integration with alert management platforms like PagerDuty for immediate notification of critical alerts.

- [->] Add support for Service Level Agreement (SLA) monitoring, with automatic calculation of uptime based on health checks.
- [->] Provide a REST API for third-party services to add their own health checks, making the system extensible.
- [->] Implement a feature for emergency shutdown or restart in case of critical failures, adding resilience to the system. [PM2]
