# SyHealthMixin Class Development:

## **Core Features**

#### Complete

- [x] Implement a custom Domain Specific Language (DSL) for defining complex health checks, supporting advanced check strategies and dependencies.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Develop a graphical dashboard for real-time health monitoring of services, showing a visual representation of system status and health check results.
  - [ ] Add multi-language support for the graphical dashboard.
- [->] Add support for WebSocket-based health checks to allow for real-time updates without constant polling.
- [->] Integrate with popular cloud-based monitoring services (like AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring) to deliver status reports to a centralized monitoring solution.
- [->] Implement a load balancing mechanism to distribute health check requests, reducing potential stress on individual services.
- [ ] Include a feature to export/import health check configurations, allowing for easy replication across environments.

#

## **Advanced Features**

#### Complete

- [x] Create automated remediation scripts that can automatically respond to common failure scenarios, potentially fixing issues before they impact the system.
- [x] Add a mechanism to perform "deep" health checks that include dependent services, tracing issues to their source and allowing for comprehensive system checks.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Develop a health check chaining system, allowing for dependencies between checks where the output of one check can be used as the input for another.checks.
- [ ] Create a maintenance mode feature, allowing for planned downtime without false alarms.
- [ ] Implement a feature to ignore specific health checks during scheduled maintenance.

#

## **Notifications and Reporting**

#### Complete

- [x] Allow for health checks to be triggered manually, not just at predefined intervals, providing flexibility in system maintenance and monitoring.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Add an option for sending health status reports to a specified email, allowing stakeholders to keep track of system health without needing to check the dashboard.
- [->] Develop SMS and push notifications alerts for real-time, critical failure notifications.
- [ ] Implement a report archiving system for historical health check data.
- [ ] Create a system for automated weekly/monthly health reports.

#

## **Health Check Interface and Options**

#### Complete

- [x] Add user permissions and authentication for health check access and control.

#### Incomplete

- [->] Implement a system for scheduling health checks at different intervals based on their importance and load, reducing system stress.
- [->] Add support for Service Level Agreement (SLA) monitoring, with automatic calculation of uptime based on health checks.
- [->] Provide a REST API for third-party services to add their own health checks, making the system extensible.
- [->] Implement a feature for emergency shutdown or restart in case of critical failures, adding resilience to the system. [PM2]
- [ ] Implement a tag-based organization system for health checks, enhancing manageability.
- [ ] Develop a feature to bulk manage health checks.

#

## **Monitoring and Logging**

#### Complete

- [ ]

#### Incomplete

- [OTW] Add support for anomaly detection in health check results, improving the detection of potential issues.
- [->] Add support for distributed tracing, improving the debugging process in a microservices architecture. [Opentelemetry]
- [->] Allow real-time streaming of health check logs, improving live monitoring capabilities.
- [->] Build an integration with alert management platforms like PagerDuty for immediate notification of critical alerts.
- [ ] Implement a data visualization module for health check logs, aiding in data analysis and decision-making.
- [ ] Develop a feature to download health check logs for offline analysis.
- [ ] Include support for log level management, controlling the verbosity of logs.

#

## **Test Coverage**

#### Complete

- [ ]

#### Incomplete

- [->] Add performance tests to simulate high load on health check endpoints, ensuring the system can handle real-world conditions.
- [->] Implement a chaos engineering system for testing the resilience of health checks, increasing the robustness of the system.
- [->] Test for resilience against common network issues (latency, packet loss, etc.), ensuring that the system can cope with less-than-ideal conditions.
- [->] Test for proper functioning in different runtime environments (OS, Node.js version), ensuring compatibility and stability.
- [ ] Create a test suite for regression testing, ensuring that new features or bug fixes do not break existing functionality.
- [ ] Implement code coverage analysis to ensure that all health check code paths are tested.
- [ ] Test multi-language support for the graphical dashboard.
- [ ] Validate SSL/TLS encryption and certificate management through testing.

#

## **Documentation and Code Quality**

#### Complete

- [x] Create detailed technical documentation explaining the architecture of the health check system, improving onboarding and development speed.
- [x] Develop a style guide for writing health checks, improving code consistency and maintainability. (with Check Classes)

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Provide code examples for common health check scenarios.
- [ ] Ensure all code follows best practices for TypeScript and includes comprehensive comments and documentation.
