## SyHealthMixin Class Development:

### Core Features

- [ ] Implement a custom Domain Specific Language (DSL) for defining complex health checks, supporting advanced check strategies and dependencies.
- [ ] Develop a graphical dashboard for real-time health monitoring of services, showing a visual representation of system status and health check results.
- [ ] Add support for WebSocket-based health checks to allow for real-time updates without constant polling.
- [ ] Integrate with popular cloud-based monitoring services (like AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring) to deliver status reports to a centralized monitoring solution.

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Create automated remediation scripts that can automatically respond to common failure scenarios, potentially fixing issues before they impact the system.
- [ ] Develop a health check chaining system, allowing for dependencies between checks where the output of one check can be used as the input for another.
- [ ] Add a mechanism to perform "deep" health checks that include dependent services, tracing issues to their source and allowing for comprehensive system checks.
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for health check endpoints to prevent misuse or Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

### Notifications and Reporting

- [ ] Add an option for sending health status reports to a specified email, allowing stakeholders to keep track of system health without needing to check the dashboard.
- [ ] Allow for health checks to be triggered manually, not just at predefined intervals, providing flexibility in system maintenance and monitoring.

## Health Check Interface and Options:

- [ ] Implement a system for scheduling health checks at different intervals based on their importance and load, reducing system stress.
- [ ] Add support for Service Level Agreement (SLA) monitoring, with automatic calculation of uptime based on health checks.
- [ ] Provide a REST API for third-party services to add their own health checks, making the system extensible.
- [ ] Enable custom health check responses, allowing users to define the structure of the output, improving integration with other systems.
- [ ] Implement a feature for emergency shutdown or restart in case of critical failures, adding resilience to the system.

## Monitoring and Logging:

- [ ] Add support for distributed tracing, improving the debugging process in a microservices architecture.
- [ ] Implement AI-driven predictions, using machine learning to forecast potential issues based on historical data.
- [ ] Allow real-time streaming of health check logs, improving live monitoring capabilities.
- [ ] Add support for anomaly detection in health check results, improving the detection of potential issues.
- [ ] Build an integration with alert management platforms like PagerDuty for immediate notification of critical alerts.

## Test Coverage:

- [ ] Add performance tests to simulate high load on health check endpoints, ensuring the system can handle real-world conditions.
- [ ] Implement a chaos engineering system for testing the resilience of health checks, increasing the robustness of the system.
- [ ] Test for resilience against common network issues (latency, packet loss, etc.), ensuring that the system can cope with less-than-ideal conditions.
- [ ] Test for proper functioning in different runtime environments (OS, Node.js version), ensuring compatibility and stability.

## Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Develop a style guide for writing health checks, improving code consistency and maintainability.
- [ ] Create detailed technical documentation explaining the architecture of the health check system, improving onboarding and development speed.
- [ ] Provide a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common issues, making it easier to resolve problems.
- [ ] Organize and document a training program for developers on how to use and extend the health check system, improving the development process.
- [ ] Conduct a thorough code review and refactor for optimizing performance and maintainability, increasing code quality and system performance.
