# **Health Check System Architecture**

## **Introduction**

The health check system is designed to verify the status and performance of different aspects of the server application. The system is comprised of the `ServerHealthMixin` class, which extends the `HealthCheckMixin` class, to provide comprehensive health check functionalities.

#

## **Key Components**

1. **HealthCheckMixin**: This is a base class that provides core functionality for registering and running health checks.

2. **ServerHealthMixin**: This class extends `HealthCheckMixin` and adds server-specific health checks, such as database connection, frontend service, system resources, and server version. It exposes these checks through a Koa router.

#

## **HealthCheckMixin**

This class provides functionalities for managing and running health checks. It supports the registration and unregistration of health checks, the execution of all registered health checks, and scheduling periodic health checks.

The health checks are stored in a map, where each key is the health check name and each value is an object containing the check function and an optional remediation function. The check function should return a promise that resolves to a boolean indicating the health status. The optional remediation function is called when the health check fails.

#

## **ServerHealthMixin**

This class adds application-specific health checks on top of the base functionality provided by `HealthCheckMixin`. These checks include:

1. **Database Health Check**: Checks the health status of the database by verifying a connection to it.
2. **Frontend Service Health Check**: Checks the health status of the frontend service by sending a request to its health check endpoint.
3. **System Resources Health Check**: Checks the availability and usage of system resources such as memory, disk space, and CPU usage.
4. **Server Version Check**: Returns the version of the server, useful for verifying the running version in environments with multiple instances.

## **Usage**

To use the health check system, an instance of `ServerHealthMixin` should be created with a `SyServer` instance and optional resource thresholds. The health checks are exposed through a Koa router, with routes for each health check.

Developers can add new health checks by creating a function that performs the check and returns a promise that resolves to a boolean indicating the health status. This function can then be registered with the `registerHealthCheck` method of `ServerHealthMixin`.

#

## **Uptime Monitoring**

The system also supports Service Level Agreement (SLA) monitoring with automatic calculation of uptime based on health checks. This is achieved by tracking the timestamps of when health checks pass and fail. The uptime for each health check can be retrieved with the `getUptime` method.

#

## **Conclusion**

The health check system is a powerful tool for monitoring the status and performance of different aspects of the server application. Its flexible and extensible design allows for easy addition of new health checks as needed.
