# TODO LIST

## SyMixin Class

- [ ] Implement detailed error handling for each method, considering various edge cases.
- [ ] Add functionality to `findItemById` to support finding by different unique identifiers (email, username, etc.)
- [ ] Refactor existing methods to reduce any code duplication and improve code readability.
- [ ] Implement additional utility methods based on common API needs (bulk updates, transaction handling, etc.)
- [ ] Revisit all methods where type 'any' is used and replace with more specific types.
- [ ] Optimize methods that are likely to cause performance bottlenecks under heavy load.
- [ ] Evaluate the use of design patterns to better structure the class as it grows in complexity.
- [ ] Implement event emitters to notify other parts of the system about significant actions in the class.
- [ ] Evaluate need for soft delete functionality in `findItemById` and other deletion methods.
- [ ] Implement a change tracking mechanism to keep a history of important data changes.
- [ ] Build a proper logging system for debugging and tracking system behaviour.
- [ ] Add detailed data validation rules in `processPayload`.
- [ ] Implement detailed pagination, sorting, and filtering options in `processQueryParams`.
- [ ] Improve user-friendliness of error messages, considering different client needs (end-users, developers, etc.)
- [ ] Expand functionality for complex queries, such as nested queries and querying across relationships.
- [ ] Implement measures to prevent SQL injection and ensure data security.
- [ ] Consider middleware for common tasks like authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Improve granularity of HTTP status codes and error messages returned by BadRequestError and NotFoundError.
- [ ] Add multi-language support for error messages and responses.

## SyMixin Interfaces and Options

- [ ] Implement a proper type or interface for `model`.
- [ ] Replace `any` in function return types with more specific types or generics.
- [ ] Allow for per-request configuration of certain behaviours.
- [ ] Create interfaces for expected request bodies based on different routes.
- [ ] Build customizable behaviours for sorting and filtering in `processQueryParams`.

## Test Coverage

- [ ] Write unit tests for all methods in `SyMixin`.
- [ ] Create tests for handling invalid inputs and edge cases.
- [ ] Evaluate class performance under high load and stress tests.
- [ ] Test class behaviour during system shutdown and unexpected interruptions.
- [ ] Mock dependencies for isolated unit testing.
- [ ] Evaluate need for integration tests to ensure correct interaction with other system parts.

## Documentation and Code Quality

- [ ] Improve comments in the code, explaining the "why" behind complex logic.
- [ ] Add JSDoc style comments for all methods, classes, and interfaces.
- [ ] Refactor complex code into simpler, smaller functions for better readability.
- [ ] Write a comprehensive README.md, covering use cases, examples, and API documentation.
- [ ] Set up a linter to enforce a consistent coding style.
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
