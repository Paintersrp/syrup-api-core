  - [ ] Check for valid types
  - [ ] Validate boundaries and logical consistency
  - [ ] Handle and report errors gracefully
- [ ] Add ability to modify options after class instantiation
  - [ ] Implement a setOptions method
  - [ ] Ensure changes to options do not disrupt ongoing operations
- [ ] Enhance the getMetadata function
  - [ ] Implement caching mechanism to improve performance on repeated requests
  - [ ] Handle all types of Sequelize model associations correctly
  - [ ] Implement a system to prevent data stampede situations
- [ ] Improve error and edge case handling for model attributes and associations fetching
  - [ ] Validate presence of attributes and associations
  - [ ] Handle unexpected data structures gracefully
- [ ] Extend stringifyDataType method
  - [ ] Handle all Sequelize data types and their options
  - [ ] Add custom serializer and deserializer for complex data types
- [ ] Implement advanced security checks
  - [ ] Review code for potential security vulnerabilities (e.g. SQL injection, DoS)
  - [ ] Implement secure coding best practices
- [ ] Implement a throttling mechanism
  - [ ] Handle high request rates gracefully
  - [ ] Allow for configuration of throttling settings
- [ ] Implement advanced logging system
  - [ ] Log important events like failed data fetching or high request rates
  - [ ] Allow for customization of log output (e.g. log levels, log formats)

## ControllerMixinOptions Interface and Class Methods:

- [ ] Create an interface for handling custom configurations in ControllerMixinOptions
  - [ ] Define required and optional properties
  - [ ] Include detailed documentation
- [ ] Implement support for handling and passing down complex model associations in getMetadata
  - [ ] Map complex association structures into easily consumable formats
  - [ ] Handle edge cases like cyclical associations

## Error Handling and Logging:

- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling for all public and important private methods
  - [ ] Capture and handle all expected errors
  - [ ] Fall back gracefully for unexpected errors
- [ ] Add verbose logging for important events and errors
  - [ ] Log errors at appropriate log levels
  - [ ] Include relevant context in log messages for easier debugging

## Test Coverage:

- [ ] Create unit tests for each method in the SyMetaMixin class
  - [ ] Test both expected outcomes and error handling
- [ ] Implement test cases for edge cases
  - [ ] Test with complex data structures
  - [ ] Test with boundary values
- [ ] Run performance tests to benchmark class methods
  - [ ] Identify and improve performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Mock dependencies for independent unit testing
  - [ ] Mock Sequelize models for testing
  - [ ] Mock external dependencies like caches or databases

## Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Improve inline comments for methods and complex logical structures
- [ ] Add JSDoc style comments for the class, its methods, and interfaces
- [ ] Refactor code for better readability and maintainability
  - [ ] Follow established design patterns and best practices
  - [ ] Break down complex methods into smaller, more manageable parts
- [ ] Update README.md with usage examples, class description, and method details
  - [ ] Provide practical examples for common use cases
  - [ ] Include details about configuration options
