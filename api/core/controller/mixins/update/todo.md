# TODO LIST

## SyUpdateMixin Class:

- [ ] Implement concurrency control for both `update` and `bulkUpdate` methods to handle race conditions
- [ ] Implement error handling for `update` method with more specific exceptions, including when a field does not exist or when the data type is incorrect
- [ ] Implement error handling for `bulkUpdate` method with more specific exceptions, including handling incomplete data or invalid fields
- [ ] Extend `processPayload` method to validate the fields being updated against a schema or model definition
- [ ] Enhance `findItemById` method to include more details in the error message, such as which ID was not found
- [ ] Implement security measures to prevent sensitive fields from being updated, such as user role or password hash
- [ ] Replace `any` TypeScript types in all methods with strict typings to increase type safety and reduce potential bugs
- [ ] Implement a transaction rollback mechanism in `bulkUpdate` method in case any single update fails
- [ ] Implement detailed logging for `update` and `bulkUpdate` methods, including before and after states and any errors
- [ ] Add exception handling for Sequelize's `save` method in `update` and `bulkUpdate` methods to handle database exceptions
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation for all methods in the `SyUpdateMixin` class, including example usage and potential exceptions
- [ ] Implement rate-limiting or throttling for `bulkUpdate` method to prevent abuse and overloading
- [ ] Add support for partial updates (PATCH) in the `update` method

## Method Enhancements and New Features:

- [ ] Implement a mechanism to optionally check for the existence of an item before updating in `update` and `bulkUpdate` methods
- [ ] Implement a method to retrieve the previous state of the items after updating for audit logging purposes
- [ ] Implement failure tolerance in `bulkUpdate` method, to continue updating other items even if one update fails
- [ ] Add a feature to create a snapshot of the database state before performing bulk updates, for possible rollback
- [ ] Implement an event-driven mechanism that emits events on successful or failed updates
- [ ] Add a feature to mark certain fields as non-updatable on a per-request basis

## Test Coverage:

- [ ] Add test cases for each public method in the `SyUpdateMixin` class
- [ ] Add test cases for handling invalid inputs and ensuring proper error messages are thrown
- [ ] Test behavior under high load, ensuring that updates can handle concurrent requests
- [ ] Test rollback behavior during failed `bulkUpdate` operations to ensure data integrity
- [ ] Mock dependencies like database and logger for unit testing, ensuring tests are isolated and reproducible
- [ ] Add stress and performance tests to verify the maximum load the update methods can handle

## Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Improve inline comments for all methods, including private helper methods
- [ ] Add JSDoc style comments for all classes, methods, and interfaces, including type definitions and return types
- [ ] Refactor code for better readability, including breaking down long methods and improving variable naming
- [ ] Create a README.md with usage examples and API documentation, including a simple step-by-step guide for new users
- [ ] Review and update existing documentation to ensure it matches the current codebase
- [ ] Setup automatic API documentation generation using tools like TypeDoc
