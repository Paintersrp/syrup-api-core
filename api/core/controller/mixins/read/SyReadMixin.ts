/**
 * @todo - Implement global error handling for all routes to maintain consistency in error responses.
 * @todo - Implement robust caching system with specific cache invalidation strategies to improve API performance.
 * @todo - Develop an advanced authorization and access control system, handling roles and permissions at a granular level.
 * @todo - Expand API documentation to include details on all methods, parameters, expected responses, and error codes.
 * @todo - Create a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all methods and middleware.
 * @todo - Build extensive input validation schemas using a library like Joi or Yup, including nested and custom validations.
 * @todo - Incorporate a centralized logging system that can track all incoming requests, system events, errors, and even be extended to handle business events.
 * @todo - Configure dynamic rate limiting to prevent abuse, taking into account factors like IP reputation, user behavior, etc.
 * @todo - Develop an efficient system for soft deletion of records that can handle dependencies between models.
 * @todo - Internationalize all response messages and errors using a robust i18n library.
 * @todo - Implement a comprehensive transaction handling system for methods requiring multiple database operations, ensuring data consistency and rollback in case of failures.
 * @todo - Continuously optimize database queries for speed and efficiency, using an ORM's debugging tools or something like the 'explain' SQL command.
 * @todo - Conduct a thorough code security audit, and integrate a tool like OWASP ZAP for ongoing vulnerability scanning.
 * @todo - Integrate with any required third-party services like payment gateways, email/SMS providers, etc., handling all the edge cases and failures.
 * @todo - Refactor code for better readability and maintainability, following a recognized style guide and using a linter for enforcing it.
 * @todo - Build a system for dealing with model associations (including eager/lazy loading, cascading updates/deletes, etc.) if applicable.
 * @todo - Implement background jobs for time-consuming operations to improve API response times and user experience.
 * @todo - Add features for versioning the API, to handle updates and breaking changes without disrupting existing clients.
 * @todo - Create a system for rate-limiting based on user's subscription level or SLA.
 * @todo - Implement an effective search functionality across different model fields and even across multiple models.
