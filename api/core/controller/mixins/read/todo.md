## TODO LIST:

### SyReadMixin Class:

- [ ] Add support for basic CRUD operations along with detailed logging for each operation
- [ ] Implement complex filter conditions including greater than, less than, in, like, etc.
- [ ] Extend support for sorting by multiple columns, and sorting within associations
- [ ] Develop robust full-text search capabilities with multi-language support
- [ ] Include support for case-insensitive and accent-insensitive sorting and filtering
- [ ] Provide handling for sparse fieldsets, and include related resources in the response
- [ ] Develop functionality for soft deletion of records, with configurable retention periods
- [ ] Create robust mechanisms for versioning of records, allowing for audit trails
- [ ] Design and implement features for nested sorting and filtering in case of associations
- [ ] Build in support for pagination and define a maximum limit to prevent DoS attacks

- [ ] Build a rate limiting system to protect the API from abuse or attacks
- [ ] Add support for secure transmission of data using HTTPS

### Test Coverage:

- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for each method and edge case
- [ ] Add stress testing to identify performance bottlenecks and stability issues under high load
- [ ] Create detailed integration tests to verify correct interaction with other services
- [ ] Develop tests for error handling to ensure the API fails gracefully
- [ ] Mock all external dependencies for reliable, isolated unit testing

### Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Add inline comments explaining complex sections of code
- [ ] Document each method, parameter, and return value using jsdoc
- [ ] Refactor and optimize the code for readability, simplicity, and performance
- [ ] Publish a comprehensive README.md with usage examples, API documentation, and contribution guidelines
