## TODO LIST:

### SyCreateMixin Class Functionality:

- [ ] Implement robust user authentication and access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized instance creation
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and recovery for the `create` and `bulkCreate` methods, including Sequelize transaction rollbacks where applicable
- [ ] Integrate structured logging using a logging library (e.g., Winston or Bunyan) to facilitate debugging, error tracking, and application monitoring
- [ ] Include data validation and sanitation before creating instances to prevent SQL injection attacks and ensure data consistency
- [ ] Implement additional RESTful endpoints as needed to support operations like update, delete, and read for completeness
- [ ] Add rate limiting to protect the API from abuse and maintain service quality
- [ ] Implement input payload size limits to prevent large payloads from causing memory or performance issues
- [ ] Consider adding pagination to the bulk create endpoint, to support large numbers of creations without overloading the server
- [ ] Develop performance benchmarks and conduct performance testing to ensure the application meets necessary performance criteria
- [ ] Consider using dependency injection to make the class more modular and easier to unit test
- [ ] Incorporate support for GraphQL in addition to REST API
- [ ] Consider support for real-time updates using WebSockets
- [ ] Add support for versioning in API endpoints
- [ ] Develop middleware for cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and request validation

### Model Interaction and Transaction Handling:

- [ ] Implement a mechanism for transaction management to ensure data consistency
- [ ] Add support for related entities in create methods (via include options or additional methods)
- [ ] Optimize bulkCreate for large input arrays (consider batching or other strategies)
- [ ] Enhance error handling to properly differentiate between validation and server errors
- [ ] Develop a mechanism to handle eventual consistency scenarios and data synchronization
- [ ] Consider support for horizontal partitioning (sharding) for large-scale data handling

### Test Coverage:

- [ ] Add test cases for each public method in SyCreateMixin class
- [ ] Add test cases for invalid inputs and error handling
- [ ] Test behavior under high load
- [ ] Mock dependencies like database and logger for unit testing
- [ ] Develop end-to-end testing scenarios to simulate real-world usage
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting and aim for high test coverage
- [ ] Develop performance tests and establish a performance baseline

### Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Review and revise JsDoc comments to ensure they accurately describe the functionality and behavior of each method and class
- [ ] Document all API endpoints using a tool such as Swagger, to provide easy-to-understand API documentation for end users
- [ ] Refactor code for better readability
- [ ] Create a README.md with usage examples and API documentation
- [ ] Develop a contributor guide to facilitate open source contributions
- [ ] Enforce a code style guide and incorporate a linter in the development process
- [ ] Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
