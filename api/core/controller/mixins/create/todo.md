## **SyCreateMixin Class Functionality**

#### Complete

- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and recovery for the `create` and `bulkCreate` methods, including Sequelize transaction rollbacks where applicable
- [x] Integrate structured logging using a logging library (e.g., Winston or Bunyan) to facilitate debugging, error tracking, and application monitoring
- [x] Include data validation and sanitation before creating instances to prevent SQL injection attacks and ensure data consistency
- [x] Implement additional RESTful endpoints as needed to support operations like update, delete, and read for completeness
- [x] Add rate limiting to protect the API from abuse and maintain service quality
- [x] Implement input payload size limits to prevent large payloads from causing memory or performance issues
- [x] Consider using dependency injection to make the class more modular and easier to unit test

#### Incomplete
