# TODO LIST:

## SyDeleteMixin Class:

- [ ] **Refactor:** Extract common logic to remove code duplication in `softDelete` and `delete` methods.
- [ ] **Functionality:** Implement a method for cascading deletes if relevant relationships are in place.
- [ ] **Functionality:** Implement a restore functionality for soft-deleted items.
- [ ] **Performance:** Analyze and optimize `delete` and `softDelete` methods for handling large datasets.
- [ ] **Performance:** Implement a queue or worker-based system for handling large bulk delete operations to prevent server overloading.
- [ ] **Validation:** Enhance input validation for `delete` and `softDelete` methods to prevent invalid ID's or data types.
- [ ] **Strategy:** Review and improve transaction handling in delete operations for better consistency.
- [ ] **Maintenance:** Review the `SyDeleteMixin` class for Single Responsibility Principle adherence. Break up the class if needed.
- [ ] **Security:** Implement role-based access control to restrict delete operations to authorized users.
- [ ] **Functionality:** Implement an undelete functionality for hard deleted items (if viable depending on storage system and deletion strategy).

## Error Handling and Logging:

- [ ] **Error-Handling:** Improve error handling in delete operations. Consider custom error classes for different types of delete errors.
- [ ] **Logging:** Implement detailed and configurable logging for delete operations. Allow turning on verbose logging when needed.
- [ ] **UX:** Improve clarity and detail of response messages after delete operations. Make sure errors clearly state what went wrong and how to correct it.

## Bulk Operations:

- [ ] **Performance:** Optimize bulk delete operations, test with larger datasets.
- [ ] **Validation:** Implement validation for bulk delete operations to ensure all IDs in the batch are valid before starting the operation.
- [ ] **Strategy:** Review and improve transaction handling in bulk delete operations.

## Test Coverage:

- [ ] **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit tests for each public and private method in the `SyDeleteMixin` class.
- [ ] **Testing:** Add more edge case tests for delete operations.
- [ ] **Testing:** Create integration tests for delete operations interacting with real or mocked databases.
- [ ] **Testing:** Test the class behavior under high load and high concurrency conditions.

## Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] **Documentation:** Improve inline comments for all methods, making sure every method and parameter is properly explained.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Add JSDoc comments for the `SyDeleteMixin` class, its methods and interfaces.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Create a detailed README.md with usage examples, best practices, and API documentation.
- [ ] **Code Quality:** Perform a full code review for the `SyDeleteMixin` class, refactoring for readability and maintainability.
- [ ] **Code Quality:** Check for and eliminate any potential memory leaks.
