## TODO LIST:

## **SyMiddlewareMixin Class**

#### Complete

- [x] Implement additional validation functions for different data types (like dates, email, phone numbers).
- [x] Introduce a middleware for body parsing with support for multiple formats (json, urlencoded, multipart).
- [x] Enable caching at a more granular level, allowing different cache durations for different endpoints.
- [x] Introduce a throttling mechanism to limit the number of requests from a client.
- [x] Add a middleware for adding security-related headers (X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options).
- [x] Develop functionality for health-check endpoints, including the status of the cache.
- [x] Introduce a middleware for serving static files with efficient caching.
- [x] Extend BadRequestError to include all validation errors, not just the first one.

#### Incomplete

- [ ]

#### Backlog

- [->] Include support for HTTP/2 push, sending critical assets along with the first HTML response.

#

## **Middleware Interface and Options**

#### Complete

- [x] Allow middleware order configuration for flexibility in processing requests.

#### Incomplete

#### Backlog

- [->] Develop feature flag middleware for turning features on/off without deploying new code.
- [->] Include support for reverse proxy headers, particularly when the application is behind a proxy.
- [->] Implement hot-reloading of configuration changes without restarting the server.

#

## **Error Handling and Logging**

#### Complete

- [x] Include correlation ID in the logs for tracing a request through all its processing stages.
- [x] Add logging rotation mechanism for better log management.
- [x] Introduce error handling for async/await syntax without try-catch blocks.

#### Incomplete

#### Backlog

#

## **Test Coverage**

#### Complete

- [ ]

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Test middleware with an array of different request payloads and headers.
- [ ] Add benchmark tests to assess the performance impact of new middleware.
- [ ] Introduce end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
- [ ] Implement load tests to understand system behavior under peak loads.
- [ ] Include mutation testing to ensure the effectiveness of unit tests.

#### Backlog

#

## **Documentation and Code Quality**

#### Complete

- [x] Improve inline comments for methods and complex logical structures
- [x] Add JSDoc style comments for the class, its methods, and interfaces
- [x] Refactor code for better readability and maintainability
- [x] Follow established design patterns and best practices
- [x] Break down complex methods into smaller, more manageable parts

#### Incomplete

#### Backlog
