## TODO LIST:

### SyMiddlewareMixin Class:

- [ ] Implement additional validation functions for different data types (like dates, email, phone numbers).
- [ ] Introduce a middleware for body parsing with support for multiple formats (json, urlencoded, multipart).
- [ ] Enable caching at a more granular level, allowing different cache durations for different endpoints.
- [ ] Extend BadRequestError to include all validation errors, not just the first one.
- [ ] Include support for HTTP/2 push, sending critical assets along with the first HTML response.
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) middleware.
- [ ] Introduce a throttling mechanism to limit the number of requests from a client.
- [ ] Add a middleware for adding security-related headers (X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options).
- [ ] Develop functionality for health-check endpoints, including the status of the cache.
- [ ] Introduce a middleware for serving static files with efficient caching.

### Middleware Interface and Options:

- [ ] Allow middleware order configuration for flexibility in processing requests.
- [ ] Develop feature flag middleware for turning features on/off without deploying new code.
- [ ] Include support for reverse proxy headers, particularly when the application is behind a proxy.
- [ ] Implement hot-reloading of configuration changes without restarting the server.

### Error Handling and Logging:

- [ ] Introduce error handling for async/await syntax without try-catch blocks.
- [ ] Include correlation ID in the logs for tracing a request through all its processing stages.
- [ ] Add logging rotation mechanism for better log management.
- [ ] Implement an Alert system when certain error thresholds are reached.

### Test Coverage:

- [ ] Test middleware with an array of different request payloads and headers.
- [ ] Add benchmark tests to assess the performance impact of new middleware.
- [ ] Introduce end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
- [ ] Implement load tests to understand system behavior under peak loads.
- [ ] Include mutation testing to ensure the effectiveness of unit tests.

### Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Add a CONTRIBUTING.md guide for developers who want to contribute to the project.
- [ ] Include a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to foster an open and welcoming environment.
- [ ] Introduce TypeScript for better type checking and autocompletion.
- [ ] Implement linting and formatting tools (like ESLint and Prettier) for consistent code style.
- [ ] Develop an architectural overview document to help new developers understand the system.

### Continuous Integration/Deployment:

- [ ] Introduce automated deployments with a CI/CD tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Implement Docker for consistent development, staging, and production environments.
- [ ] Automate performance regression testing for each new release.
- [ ] Introduce blue/green or canary deployment for minimizing the impact of faulty releases.
