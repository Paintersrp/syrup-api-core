# TODO LIST

## **SyController Class**

#### Complete

- [x] Implement additional methods for database operations (e.g., soft delete, bulk operations)
- [x] Add a logging mechanism to track each request and response
- [x] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API
- [x] Introduce input validation for all CRUD operations
- [x] Consider adding hooks to execute code before or after certain operations (e.g., beforeCreate, afterUpdate)
- [x] Enhance error handling for more specific errors and improve user-facing error messages
- [x] Add support for session-based authentication or token-based authentication
- [x] Develop advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination for the `all` method
- [x] Design and implement a mechanism to manage users' permissions and roles
- [x] Integrate a data-validation library to validate and sanitize input data

#### Incomplete

- [WIP] Explore adding an audit log system for tracking changes in data

#### Backlog

- [->] Implement internationalization (i18n) support for error messages and other user-facing strings
- [->] Extend rate limiting to support more complex rules (e.g., dynamic rules based on user behavior)

##

## **Mixins and Other Class Relations**

#### Complete

- [x] Improve the use of mixins and ensure they enhance code readability and reusability
- [x] Evaluate the need for a meta mixin for metadata handling
- [x] Examine the relationship between SyController and SyModel

#### Incomplete

- [x] Investigate the use of more sophisticated design patterns to improve code organization and reusability
- [x] Analyze whether there are additional functionalities that can be abstracted into mixins

#### Backlog

- [->] Implement abstract classes or interfaces to ensure consistent method signatures across models

##

## **Transaction Handling**

#### Complete

- [x] Refine transaction rollback mechanism in case of errors
- [x] Consider adding a retry mechanism for failed transactions
- [x] Design and implement an automatic recovery mechanism for failed transactions

#### Incomplete

- [ ]

#### Backlog

- [->] Develop advanced error handling for transaction rollbacks
- [->] Extend the transaction management system to support multiple databases
- [->] Implement a mechanism for distributed transactions

##

## **Middleware**

#### Complete

- [x] Evaluate the use of custom middlewares and enhance their functionality
- [x] Implement advanced features in middleware such as caching, compression, or throttling
- [x] Add more granular control for adding middleware to different routes
- [x] Create a middleware for request/response transformation
- [x] Setup middleware for security features like CORS and helmet
- [x] Implement API request rate limiting as a middleware

#### Incomplete

- [ ]

#### Backlog

- [->] Develop middleware to support real-time updates with WebSocket

##

## **Test Coverage**

#### Complete

#### Incomplete

- [ ] Add test cases for each public method in SyController class
- [ ] Add test cases for invalid inputs and error handling
- [ ] Test behavior under high load (stress testing)
- [ ] Mock dependencies like database and logger for unit testing
- [ ] Integrate end-to-end testing
- [ ] Setup Continuous Integration (CI) for automated testing with each commit
- [ ] Include code coverage in the test suite and aim for a high percentage
- [ ] Design and implement performance tests

##

## **Documentation and Code Quality**

#### Complete

- [x] Improve inline comments for all methods
- [x] Add JSDoc style comments for all classes, methods, and interfaces
- [x] Refactor code for better readability
- [x] Create a README.md with usage examples and API documentation

#### Incomplete

- [ ]

##

## **Performance Optimization**

#### Complete

- [x] Test and optimize the application for memory usage
- [x] Evaluate performance and optimize high-load endpoints

#### Incomplete

- [WIP] Implement a mechanism for query optimization

#### Backlog

- [->] Consider adding a load balancer for handling high traffic

---
### 1. Enhance Documentation

- [x] Document all decorators used in class and methods
- [x] Provide a comprehensive overview of class responsibilities

Read Config for each model... Like Serializers

```bash
class UserModel extends Model {
  //...
  static minimalFieldset = ['id', 'username'];
  static include = [{
    model: RoleModel,
    as: 'role',
    attributes: ['name'],
  }];
}

// In your SyReadMixin
public async read(ctx: Router.RouterContext) {
  const id = ctx.params.id;
  const result = await findOneWithFieldset(UserModel, 'minimalFieldset', {
    where: { id },
    include: [
      {
        model: CompanyModel,
        as: 'company',
        attributes: ['name', 'address']
      }
    ]
  });

  ctx.body = result;
}

function findOneWithFieldset(model, fieldset, options = {}) {
  let attributes = options.attributes || model[fieldset];
  let include = options.include || [];

  let baseInclude = model.include || [];
  baseInclude.forEach(baseInclusion => {
    let match = include.find(inc => inc.model === baseInclusion.model);

    if (match) {
      match.attributes = match.attributes || baseInclusion.attributes;
      if (baseInclusion.include) {
        match.include = match.include || [];
        match.include.push(...baseInclusion.include);
      }
    } else {
      include.push(baseInclusion);
    }
  });

  return model.findOne({ ...options, attributes, include });
}



```
