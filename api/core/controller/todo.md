# TODO LIST

## SyController Class:

- [ ] Implement additional methods for database operations (e.g., soft delete, bulk operations)
- [ ] Add a logging mechanism to track each request and response
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API
- [ ] Introduce input validation for all CRUD operations
- [ ] Consider adding hooks to execute code before or after certain operations (e.g., beforeCreate, afterUpdate)
- [ ] Enhance error handling for more specific errors and improve user-facing error messages
- [ ] Add support for session-based authentication or token-based authentication

## Mixins and Other Class Relations:

- [ ] Improve the use of mixins and ensure they enhance code readability and reusability
- [ ] Evaluate the need for a meta mixin for metadata handling
- [ ] Examine the relationship between SyController and SyModel

## Transaction Handling:

- [ ] Refine transaction rollback mechanism in case of errors
- [ ] Consider adding a retry mechanism for failed transactions

## Middleware:

- [ ] Evaluate the use of custom middlewares and enhance their functionality
- [ ] Add more granular control for adding middleware to different routes
- [ ] Implement advanced features in middleware such as caching, compression, or throttling

## Test Coverage:

- [ ] Add test cases for each public method in SyController class
- [ ] Add test cases for invalid inputs and error handling
- [ ] Test behavior under high load (stress testing)
- [ ] Mock dependencies like database and logger for unit testing

## Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Improve inline comments for all methods
- [ ] Add JSDoc style comments for all classes, methods, and interfaces
- [ ] Refactor code for better readability
- [ ] Create a README.md with usage examples and API documentation
