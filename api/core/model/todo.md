## TODO LIST:

### SyModel<TAttributes, TCreationAttributes> Class:

- [ ] Implement support for Paranoid Fields (Soft deletes)
- [ ] Implement support for Composite keys and proper handling of complex primary keys
- [ ] Include built-in support for handling associations (One-To-One, One-To-Many, Many-To-Many)
- [ ] Develop the ability to define and handle indexes and unique constraints within the model definition
- [ ] Provide support for default values and optional fields for various DataTypes
- [ ] Implement built-in hooks (beforeSave, afterSave, etc.) and expose interfaces for custom hooks
- [ ] Implement support for custom setter and getter methods for more complex data manipulation
- [ ] Develop a methodology for defining and using Sequelize scopes
- [ ] Implement built-in methods and strategies for transaction handling to maintain data integrity
- [ ] Add support for multi-database operations and configurations
- [ ] Include robust error handling mechanism for DB related operations
- [ ] Develop field-level validation error handling and support for custom field validators
- [ ] Implement an interface to allow user-defined custom DataTypes
- [ ] Add a feature for versioning of models (Optimistic Locking)
- [ ] Implement hierarchical data handling with a closure table or path enumeration

### Optimization and Enhancements:

- [ ] Optimize the handling of large datasets (Lazy Loading, Eager Loading)
- [ ] Add support for batch operations like bulkCreate, bulkUpdate and bulkDelete
- [ ] Implement pagination and sorting mechanisms for large data retrieval
- [ ] Improve DB operation logging for better debugging and traceability
- [ ] Include configurable options for connection pooling for enhanced performance
- [ ] Add a replication feature for Read and Write separation
- [ ] Develop an automated migration and seeding system for managing database schema changes
- [ ] Implement a system to capture and handle database events (LISTEN/NOTIFY in PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Add support for spatial and geographic fields and queries

### Test Coverage:

- [ ] Add unit test cases for each method in SyModel class
- [ ] Add integration test cases with actual database interaction
- [ ] Develop test cases for invalid inputs, error handling, and edge cases
- [ ] Test SyModel behavior under high load and concurrent transactions
- [ ] Implement performance testing for large datasets and complex queries
- [ ] Mock dependencies like database and logger for unit testing

### Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Improve inline comments for all methods and functionalities
- [ ] Add detailed JSDoc style comments for all classes, methods, and interfaces
- [ ] Refactor code for better readability, maintenance and adherence to best practices
- [ ] Implement a type checking mechanism for TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Create a comprehensive README.md with usage examples, API documentation, and guidelines

### CI/CD Pipeline:

- [ ] Set up linting (ESLint), code formatting (Prettier) and other static code analysis tools
- [ ] Create a CI/CD pipeline for testing, building and deploying code (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD)
- [ ] Implement automated versioning and release system (Semantic Versioning)
- [ ] Add a feature for code coverage report generation (Istanbul, Coveralls)
