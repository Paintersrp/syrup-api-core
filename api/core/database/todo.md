# TODO LIST:

## SyDatabase Class:

- [ ] Implement different database connection pool strategies (like a fixed size, dynamic size, etc.)
- [ ] Add functionality to log all database operations, not just errors
- [ ] Implement a configurable connection timeout setting for the Sequelize instance
- [ ] Implement data sharding strategies for large datasets
- [ ] Support other database dialects in backupDatabase() method
- [ ] Implement a restoreDatabase() method to restore a backup
- [ ] Add bulk operations support like transaction management for batch operations
- [ ] Implement a system to handle database connection drop situations (automatic reconnect, exponential backoff)
- [ ] Include query timeout setting in the query options
- [ ] Add support for read and write replicas
- [ ] Provide an option for automated database migration handling
- [ ] Add support for database failover mechanisms
- [ ] Implement secure data masking and anonymization for privacy

## Database Health Check:

- [ ] Optimize the health check mechanism, make it more intelligent (e.g., adaptive retry delay based on previous failures)
- [ ] Create an interface to allow for custom health checks
- [ ] Implement a routine to clean up idle or stale connections from the pool

## Error Logging and Query Logging:

- [ ] Add customizable log levels for different types of operations
- [ ] Implement query optimization suggestions in query log for slow queries
- [ ] Add option to store logs persistently (e.g., to disk, cloud logging service, etc.)
- [ ] Implement a mechanism for auditing database transactions
- [ ] Log database resource utilization statistics

## Query and Data Management:

- [ ] Add support for complex data types and their operations
- [ ] Implement ORM-level caching to improve performance
- [ ] Add support for data indexing for efficient data retrieval
- [ ] Implement data partitioning strategies for large tables

## Automated Testing:

- [ ] Extend runAutomatedTests() method with more complex test cases
- [ ] Test behavior under high database load
- [ ] Mock dependencies like database and logger for unit testing
- [ ] Test behavior during system shutdown and recovery
- [ ] Add tests for database schema consistency and validation

## Documentation and Code Quality:

- [ ] Improve inline comments for all methods
- [ ] Add jsdoc style comments for all classes, methods, and interfaces
- [ ] Refactor code for better readability
- [ ] Create a README.md with usage examples and API documentation
- [ ] Document database schema and data flow diagrams

## Scalability:

- [ ] Implement scalability strategies for production (like sharding, read-write splitting, etc.)
- [ ] Implement mechanism for managing database resources based on load
- [ ] Add support for distributed database systems
