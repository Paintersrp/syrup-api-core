  - Handled in DB Config
    ###
- [x] ~~Add functionality to log all database operations, not just errors~~
- [x] ~~Implement a configurable connection timeout setting for the Sequelize instance~~
  - Handled in DB Config
    ###
- [x] ~~Support other database dialects in backupDatabase() method~~
- [x] ~~Implement a restoreDatabase() method to restore a backup~~
- [x] ~~Add bulk operations support like transaction management for batch operations~~
- [x] ~~Implement a system to handle database connection drop situations (automatic reconnect, exponential backoff)~~
  - Handled in DB Config
    ###
- [x] ~~Include query timeout setting in the query options~~

#### - **[!] Provide an option for automated database migration handling**

###

- [->] Implement data sharding strategies for large datasets
- [->] Add support for read and write replicas
  - Config Option Implementation
    ###

## ~~Database Health Check:~~

- [x] ~~Optimize the health check mechanism, make it more intelligent (e.g., adaptive retry delay based on previous failures)~~
- [x] ~~Create an interface to allow for custom health checks~~
- [x] ~~Implement a routine to clean up idle or stale connections from the pool~~
  - Handled in DB Config
    ###

## ~~Error Logging and Query Logging:~~

- [x] ~~Add customizable log levels for different types of operations~~
- [x] ~~Implement query optimization suggestions in query log for slow queries~~
- [x] ~~Add option to store logs persistently (e.g., to disk, cloud logging service, etc.)~~
- [x] ~~Implement a mechanism for auditing database transactions~~
- [x] ~~Log database resource utilization statistics~~

## ~~Query and Data Management:~~

- [x] ~~Add support for complex data types and their operations~~

- [x] ~~Add jsdoc style comments for all classes, methods, and interfaces~~
- [x] ~~Refactor code for better readability~~
- [x] ~~Create a README.md with usage examples and API documentation~~

## **Automated Testing:**

- [x] ~~Extend runAutomatedTests() method with more complex test cases~~
- [x] ~~Test behavior under high database load~~
- [x] ~~Mock dependencies like database and logger for unit testing~~

###

- [->] Test behavior during system shutdown and recovery
- [->] Add tests for database schema consistency and validation
- [->] Implement Jest Test Library
- [->] 100% Coverage

## **Future Dev:**
