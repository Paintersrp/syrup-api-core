## TODO LIST

### SyRoutes<T> Class

- [ ] Add support for more HTTP methods (e.g., PATCH, OPTIONS)
- [ ] Implement route-specific middleware (authentication, authorization)
- [ ] Implement middleware for input validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement functionality to add custom routes outside of basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement a mechanism to rate limit requests to protect against DoS attacks
- [ ] Add support for route versioning
- [ ] Add optional support for SSL/TLS encryption
- [ ] Implement support for OAuth or JWT for secure route access
- [ ] Include response formatting options (e.g., XML, JSON, CSV)
- [ ] Consider integration with web sockets for real-time data handling
- [ ] Add support for header-based routing (e.g., Content-Type, Accept-Language)
- [ ] Introduce throttling mechanism to manage API usage and ensure fair access

### Router Configuration and Interface

- [ ] Create an interface to define custom routing rules
- [ ] Allow configuration of routing case sensitivity and strict routing
- [ ] Implement mechanism to handle query string parameters
- [ ] Introduce wildcard and parameterized routes
- [ ] Introduce a routing table for route management and visualization
- [ ] Implement support for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- [ ] Add middleware for request/response transformation (e.g., compression, body parsing)

### Controller Configuration and Integration

- [ ] Optimize controller integration, currently all routes are initialized during controller assignment
- [ ] Add mechanism to dynamically change controller at runtime
- [ ] Introduce support for controller grouping for more organized code
- [ ] Add a mechanism to handle database transaction propagation across controllers

### Test Coverage

- [ ] Add test cases for each public method in SyRoutes class
- [ ] Add test cases for each HTTP method and endpoint
- [ ] Test routing behavior under high load
- [ ] Test behavior with invalid inputs and error handling
- [ ] Mock dependencies like database and logger for unit testing
- [ ] Add stress testing to verify system stability and performance
- [ ] Test behavior with various response sizes and types
- [ ] Test security aspects such as injection attacks, access control, etc.

### Documentation and Code Quality

- [ ] Improve inline comments for all methods
- [ ] Add jsdoc style comments for all classes, methods, and interfaces
- [ ] Refactor code for better readability
- [ ] Create a README.md with usage examples and API documentation
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines for other developers
- [ ] Ensure code adheres to a consistent style guide
- [ ] Implement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- [ ] Conduct code reviews and static code analysis for quality assurance
