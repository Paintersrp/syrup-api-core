#

## Feature Enhancements

- [->] Develop a feature for batch anomaly detection.

- [x] Add support for other types of anomalies beyond Z-score.
- [x] Implement a feature to visualize the anomaly data in a meaningful way.

#

## Code Refactoring

- [x] Break down complex methods in `CalculatorService` into simpler, testable ones.
- [x] Move commonly used utility functions into a separate `utils` module.
- [x] Refactor `AnomalyManager` and `HistoryManager` to improve code readability and maintainability.

#

## AI/ML Integration

- [->] Research and identify suitable AI/ML models for anomaly detection.
- [->] Integrate AI/ML models into the existing system for enhanced anomaly detection.
- [->] Develop a training pipeline for these models.

#

## Optimization

- [->] Optimize memory usage in `HistoryManager` [ORM or Redis].

- [x] Improve data retrieval speed in `AnomalyManager` by using suitable data structures or indexing techniques.

#

## Testing

- [ ] Increase test coverage by adding tests for edge cases.
- [ ] Implement performance tests to ensure the system performs well under heavy load.
- [ ] Integrate with a Continuous Integration system for automated testing.

#

## Documentation

- [ ] Update existing documentation to reflect the changes and new features.
- [ ] Readme
- [ ] Document the AI/ML models used and their training process.
