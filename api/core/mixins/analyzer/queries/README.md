# Query Log Analyzer: Comprehensive Log Analysis Tool

The Query Log Analyzer is an advanced, extensible, and robust tool designed to provide insightful analysis on SQL query logs. It houses a suite of methods to sort, filter, analyze logs, count parameters, and aggregate metrics and frequencies. Developed as an integral component of our larger toolset, it empowers developers with key insights into the usage patterns and performance of their SQL databases.

## Architecture and Design

The architecture of the Query Log Analyzer is meticulously planned and implemented to be highly flexible, scalable, and future-proof. The system extends from a base `LogAnalyzer` class, specifically designed to process logs of type `QueryReportLogObject`.

The Query Log Analyzer encompasses two categories of methods: public and private. The core, public method `analyzeLogs`, is the primary interface for users, providing a comprehensive aggregated report from the loaded logs. The suite of private methods support the log analysis procedure internally, offering enhanced modularity and ease of maintenance.

Key architectural decisions incorporated into the design are:

1. **Focused Separation of Concerns**: The class maintains distinct metrics for query types and model names, providing granular insights into the functioning of your system.
2. **Robust Flexibility**: A generic `aggregateMetrics` method facilitates aggregation based on diverse parameters. By simply accepting the log, the aggregate object for update, and the field in the log's context to aggregate on, it caters to future metrics additions with minimal changes in the existing code.
3. **Effective Validation**: The architecture ensures that only valid logs are considered for analysis. Logs are valid if they aren't of types `SHOWTABLES`, `SHOWINDEXES`, `DEFERRED` and if the SQL query is not `SELECT 1+1 AS result`. This precludes any system queries from skewing the analytical results.

## Detailed API Documentation

### `analyzeLogs() : QueryLogReport`

`analyzeLogs` is the principal public method offered by the Query Log Analyzer, driving the log analysis process. It returns an insightful report encompassing various crucial metrics. However, if no logs have been loaded into the system, it throws an error.

The resulting report presents a holistic view of your logs, with metrics including:

- Total number of queries
- Average query duration
- Longest and shortest query durations
- Metrics aggregated by query type and model name
- Most frequently used parameters
- Hourly query frequency

Example usage:

```javascript
const analyzer = new QueryLogAnalyzer(logs);
const report = analyzer.analyzeLogs();
console.log(report);
```

## Quick Start Guide

Generate an instance of the QueryLogAnalyzer with your logs:

```javascript
const logs = [
  {
    time: '2023-08-01T10:30:00.000Z',
    context: {
      type: 'SELECT',
      sql: 'SELECT * FROM Users WHERE id = ?',
      sqlParameters: ['id'],
      modelName: 'User',
      duration: 10,
    },
  },
  // Additional logs...
];

const analyzer = new QueryLogAnalyzer(logs);
```

Invoke the `analyzeLogs` method and let the system generate a comprehensive report:

```javascript
const report = analyzer.analyzeLogs();
console.log(report);
```

By following these instructions, you will be able to derive meaningful analysis from your logs, opening new opportunities for performance optimization, debugging, and system insight. Happy analyzing!
