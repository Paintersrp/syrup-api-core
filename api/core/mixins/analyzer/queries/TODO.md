# QueryLogAnalyzer Module: Comprehensive ToDo Checklist

## Code Refactoring and Optimizations

- [ ] **Break down `analyzeLogs` method**: The `analyzeLogs` method has too many responsibilities. Consider breaking it down into multiple smaller methods to improve readability and maintainability.
- [ ] **Optimize date operations**: The `sortLogsByTimestamp` and `aggregateHourlyFrequency` methods use the `Date` object which could be inefficient. Investigate the possibility of optimizing date handling, possibly by storing dates as timestamps.
- [ ] **Validate logs early**: Implement early log validation during log initialization or creation. This could simplify the `analyzeLogs` method and avoid unnecessary operations on invalid logs.
- [ ] **Improve validation in `isValidLog` method**: The log type and SQL content are hardcoded. Consider moving these values to a configuration file or use a more flexible validation strategy, such as regex patterns or validation classes.
- [ ] **Improve aggregation in `aggregateMetrics` method**: Consider refactoring this method to use a more dynamic approach that could handle any field in the log's context, not just 'type' and 'modelName'.
- [ ] **Refactor `countParameters` method**: This method assumes SQL parameters are already extracted. Consider implementing parameter extraction within the method itself, handling different formats of SQL queries.

## Tests

- [ ] **Implement unit tests for all methods**: Each method should have its own set of unit tests covering all possible cases, including edge cases and error handling.
- [ ] **Implement integration tests**: Test the interaction between different methods, as well as the interaction with other modules or external systems (like a database or an API).
- [ ] **Add tests for performance and scalability**: Check how the module behaves under heavy load, with a large number of logs, or with very long SQL queries.

## Error Handling and Logging

- [ ] **Implement comprehensive error handling**: All methods should catch and handle errors, possibly propagating them up to the caller when necessary. Validate input parameters and throw meaningful error messages.
- [ ] **Add logging**: Use a robust logging library to track the module's activity. Include different levels of logs (debug, info, warning, error) and make sure to log important events as well as any errors or exceptions.

## Documentation

- [ ] **Improve code comments**: Make sure all methods and complex blocks of code are well-commented.
- [ ] **Update docstrings**: Ensure each method has a descriptive and up-to-date docstring, following a standard format (like JSDoc).
- [ ] **Create a README for the module**: The README should describe what the module does, how to use it, and any important details or considerations.
- [ ] **Document the format of the logs**: Provide a detailed explanation of what each field in the log represents.

## New Features and Improvements

- [ ] **Support more frequency counts**: Extend the `analyzeLogs` method to provide daily, weekly, and monthly frequency counts.
- [ ] **Parameterize the `getTop` method**: Instead of hardcoding the number of top parameters to return, make it an optional parameter of the `analyzeLogs` method.
- [ ] **Make the validation rules configurable**: Allow the caller to specify what types of logs should be considered valid, and what SQL content should be ignored.
- [ ] **Support more SQL dialects**: The module should be able to handle different SQL dialects and different formats of SQL queries.
- [ ] **Implement support for real-time analysis**: Instead of analyzing the logs only when the `analyzeLogs` method is called, consider implementing real-time or incremental analysis.
