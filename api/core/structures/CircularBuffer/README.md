### Space Complexity:

- **Buffer**: The buffer itself takes `O(n)` space, where `n` is the size of the buffer.
- **Other Variables**: The additional variables (`size`, `start`, `end`, `count`) are constant in space, contributing `O(1)`.

So the overall space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Time Complexity:

- **Enqueue**: `O(1)` - Inserting an element at the end takes constant time.
- **Dequeue**: `O(1)` - Removing an element from the start takes constant time.
- **Peek**: `O(1)` - Accessing the element at the start takes constant time.
- **isEmpty**: `O(1)` - Checking the count takes constant time.
- **isFull**: `O(1)` - Checking the count takes constant time.
- **getSize**: `O(1)` - Accessing the count takes constant time.

All the primary operations of the Circular Buffer are performed in constant time, making the time complexity of these operations `O(1)`.

### Efficiency:

- **Memory Utilization**: The Circular Buffer uses a fixed amount of memory and reuses it, making it memory-efficient, especially in scenarios where data needs to be continuously added and removed.
- **Performance**: The constant-time operations ensure high performance, suitable for real-time applications and systems with high-throughput requirements.

In summary, this Circular Buffer implementation is efficient in terms of both space and time complexity. It's suitable for various applications, including data streaming, real-time processing, queue management, and more. By ensuring constant-time operations and fixed memory utilization, it aligns well with the principles of an efficient data structure.
