## **More metrics to collect**:

- **Peak and off-peak hours**: Analyze the timestamps of your logs to figure out when your system is most and least active. This could help in capacity planning and understanding user behavior. [Base?]
- **Geographical information**: If the IP addresses can be resolved to locations, it might be useful to track usage by geography. [Future]
- **Endpoint usage**: If you have different endpoints or APIs, tracking their usage could be insightful. [?]

#

## **More details in the report**

- **Trends over time**: For each of the metrics you are tracking, showing trends over time can provide more context. For example, are the number of denied requests increasing or decreasing over time? What about the number of unique users? [Future]
- **User-specific reports**: Generate reports specific to individual users, showing their usage patterns and history. [Future]
- **Role-specific reports**: Similar to user-specific reports, generate reports for different roles. [Future]
