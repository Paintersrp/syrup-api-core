# `ErrorReportGenerator`

## **Optimizations**

- [x] Review the storage structure of `metrics` to ensure it's memory efficient.
- [x] Consider batching when processing large log files.
- [x] Optimize the `updateMetrics` method for better performance.
- [x] Consider using a more efficient sorting algorithm for `getTopWithCount`.

#

## **Additions**

- [x] Implement a method to retrieve errors within a specific time range.
- [x] Enable the export of the error report in multiple formats (e.g. JSON, CSV).

#

## **Miscellaneous Tasks**

- [x] Update method comments for better clarity.
- [x] Add a module-level docstring explaining the purpose and usage of the `ErrorReportGenerator` class.
- [x] Provide examples of how to use the module in the documentation.

#

## **Error Classification**

- [x] Implement an error tagging system for better categorization.
- [x] Introduce pattern recognition for automatic error classification.

#

## **Error Severity**

- [x] Implement a severity ranking system (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).

#

## **Testing**:

- [ ] Implement unit tests for all methods.
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for the entire flow.
- [ ] Create mock error logs for testing purposes.

#

## **Deployment / Future**

- [->] Consider adding a machine learning model for more advanced error pattern detection.

- [->] Implement a method to notify when error frequency surpasses a certain threshold.
- [->] Implement a system to notify immediately for critical errors.
- [->] Introduce notifications for different severity levels (e.g., SMS for critical).
