## Code Improvement Tasks

### Metrics Collection

- [x] Optimize metrics collection process
  - [x] Review existing logic for correctness and efficiency
  - [x] Optimize loops to reduce computation time
  - [x] Consider using a map/reduce approach

### Optimization

- [x] Optimize performance
  - [x] Based on profiling, improve slow parts of the code
  - [x] Consider time and space complexity of algorithms

### New Features

- [x] Explore and plan for additional features
  - [x] More metrics to collect
  - [x] More details in the report

### Technical Debt

  - [x] Identify areas of the code that need improvement
  - [x] Plan and prioritize refactoring efforts

## Documentation

### Code Comments

- [x] Ensure comprehensive code documentation
  - [x] Document every public method with JSDoc comments
  - [x] Document complex logic within private methods

### README

- [x] Create README file
  - [x] Reflect current state of the module
  - [x] Provide clear installation, usage instructions
  - [x] Describe module's purpose, and context

## Security

- [ ] Conduct a security audit
  - [ ] Identify potential vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Implement necessary safeguards

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Coverage for each public method
- [ ] Coverage for each private method where necessary
- [ ] Implement comprehensive integration tests
  - [ ] Test `analyzeLogs` method with different log inputs
  - [ ] Test interaction with other parts of the system
- [ ] Analyze and improve test coverage
  - [ ] Aim for 85%+ code coverage
