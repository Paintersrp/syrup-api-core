## Code Improvement Tasks

### General Code Quality

- [ ] Ensure adherence to clean code principles throughout the module
  - [ ] Consistent formatting
  - [ ] Clear and meaningful naming conventions
  - [ ] Methods/functions do one thing only
  - [ ] Code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] Add comprehensive comments to clarify complex code segments
- [ ] Enforce static typing where possible to improve code reliability

### Refactoring

- [ ] Refactor `collectMetrics` and `createReport` methods
  - [ ] Identify areas of code duplication
  - [ ] Simplify complex logic
- [ ] Refactor `addLogToMetrics` for modularity
  - [ ] Split into smaller, more specific functions

### Error Handling

- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
  - [ ] Validate function arguments
  - [ ] Provide clear error messages
  - [ ] Gracefully handle external failures (file not found, etc.)

### Metrics Collection

- [ ] Optimize metrics collection process
  - [ ] Review existing logic for correctness and efficiency
  - [ ] Optimize loops to reduce computation time
  - [ ] Consider using a map/reduce approach

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests
  - [ ] Coverage for each public method
  - [ ] Coverage for each private method where necessary

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Implement comprehensive integration tests
  - [ ] Test `analyzeLogs` method with different log inputs
  - [ ] Test interaction with other parts of the system

### Test Coverage

- [ ] Analyze and improve test coverage
  - [ ] Aim for 80%+ code coverage
  - [ ] Identify areas of low coverage

## Documentation

### Code Comments

- [ ] Ensure comprehensive code documentation
  - [ ] Document every public method with JSDoc comments
  - [ ] Document complex logic within private methods

### README

- [ ] Improve README file
  - [ ] Reflect current state of the module
  - [ ] Provide clear installation, usage instructions
  - [ ] Describe module's purpose, and context

### API Documentation

- [ ] Update API documentation
  - [ ] Reflect any changes to the module's public interface
  - [ ] Clear examples of API usage

## Performance

### Profiling

- [ ] Profile the module to identify bottlenecks
  - [ ] Focus on loops, IO operations, and heavy computations

### Optimization

- [ ] Optimize performance
  - [ ] Based on profiling, improve slow parts of the code
  - [ ] Consider time and space complexity of algorithms

## Security

- [ ] Conduct a security audit
  - [ ] Identify potential vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Implement necessary safeguards

## Future Improvement Ideas

### New Features

- [ ] Explore and plan for additional features
  - [ ] More metrics to collect
  - [ ] More details in the report

### Technical Debt

- [ ] Track and manage technical debt
  - [ ] Identify areas of the code that need improvement
  - [ ] Plan and prioritize refactoring efforts

### Code Review

- [ ] Conduct thorough code reviews
  - [ ] Address issues identified during code reviews
  - [ ] Implement best practices from code review feedback
