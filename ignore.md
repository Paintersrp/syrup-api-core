# My Koa Project Roadmap

## Q3 2023

1. **Server and Core Modules Improvement**

   - Enhance `SyServer` startup and shutdown operations.
   - Extend the functionality of `SyCache` to support distributed caching mechanisms.
   - Add transactions support to `SyDatabase`.
   - Introduce more utility methods to the `SyController`.

2. **Middleware Expansion**

   - Improve JWT handling with a refresh token system.
   - Develop a middleware for request data sanitization.
   - Integrate a CORS middleware for cross-origin resource sharing.

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**
   - Develop more custom error classes under the `SyError` module.
   - Improve error logging with better context and stack trace analysis.

## Q4 2023

1. **Data Validation and Schema Improvement**

   - Refactor `SyModel` to support more complex validation rules.
   - Implement data transformation in the validation process.

2. **API and Routes**

   - Extend `SyRoutes` to support WebSocket communication.
   - Implement GraphQL API endpoints along with the existing REST API.

3. **Decorators**

   - Create custom decorators to handle common tasks like caching, transaction management, and error handling.

4. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Establish a comprehensive unit and integration testing suite.
   - Improve inline code comments and module-level documentation.

## Q1 2024

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - Implement database query optimization in `SyDatabase`.
   - Add cache performance metrics in `SyCache`.
   - Fine-tune server performance parameters in `SyServer`.

2. **Security Enhancement**

   - Upgrade the RBAC middleware to support attribute-based access control (ABAC).
   - Incorporate an audit logging system.
   - Harden JWT handling and implement token blacklisting.

3. **Logging**
   - Introduce a log aggregation system, possibly a third-party solution.
   - Improve logging format for easier parsing and analysis.

## Q2 2024

1. **Scalability**

   - Refactor `SyServer` to support horizontal scaling.
   - Extend `SyCache` to support a distributed cache mechanism.

2. **Configuration Management**

   - Improve the settings and configuration module to support dynamic configuration changes without server restart.
   - Implement encryption for sensitive configuration data.

3. **Project Management and Collaboration**
   - Develop a comprehensive contributors guide.
   - Improve the project's issue and pull request templates.

Please note, this roadmap provides a high-level overview of the planned enhancements and improvements. The details and actual implementation may vary based on the project's evolution, community feedback, and technical constraints.
