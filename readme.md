## 🏗️ Project Structure

Our project structure prioritizes developer experience with a clear separation of backend and frontend files. Frontend structure is recommended, but not opinionated within the CLI.

### 🎛️ Backend Structure:

- `src/controllers`: Houses logic needed for handling incoming requests and sending responses.
- `src/docs`: Contains auto-generated Swagger documentation for your APIs.
- `src/logs`: Stores structured logs for monitoring the application's behavior.
- `src/models`: Defines the structure of your database tables in Sequelize.
- `src/routes`: Defines the endpoints of your application where requests are sent.
- `src/schemas`: Handles automatic generation of database schemas.
- `src/settings`: Stores configuration details and settings for your application.
- `src/types`: Contains custom TypeScript types used across the application.
- `.env`: Stores environment variables for your application.
- `main.ts`: The entry point of your application.

### 🎨 Frontend Structure (Bulletproof React Structure):

- `src/components`: Contains all the React components used in the application.
- `src/features`: Houses the main features of your application, divided into separate modules.
- `src/hooks`: Stores custom React hooks used throughout your application.
- `src/libs`: Contains any libraries or utilities used across your application.
- `src/providers`: Defines React context providers.
- `src/routes`: Defines the routing structure of your application.
- `src/settings`: Stores configuration details and settings for your application.
- `src/stores`: Contains Zustand states for state management.
- `src/theme`: Contains styling and theming details for your application.
- `src/types`: Contains custom TypeScript types used across the application.
- `src/utils`: Stores utility functions used across the application.
- `App.tsx`: The main React component that starts your application.
- `index.html`: The HTML file that serves as the entry point of your application.
- `main.tsx`: The entry point of your application.
- `App.css`: Contains global CSS styles for your application.

This structured environment ensures a clear separation of concerns, making it easy to locate files and work on different parts of the application independently.

## 🛣️ Syrup's Roadmap

At Syrup, we are always brewing new features to supercharge your web development journey even further. Our roadmap illustrates the ambitious trajectory we have planned. Here's a preview of what's on the horizon:

### 🚀 **GraphQL Integration**

We're broadening our horizons by integrating GraphQL. This will empower you to construct more flexible, client-driven APIs, ensuring efficient data loading and better overall performance.

### 🏢 **Microservices Architecture Support**

To enhance scalability and foster independent development, we're laying the groundwork for a robust microservices architecture. This will allow different teams to work on separate services, boosting productivity, and deployment speed.

### ⚡ **Real-Time Data Handling**

We're driving towards a more interactive web by introducing real-time data handling capabilities. This will unlock a plethora of dynamic features such as live chat, real-time notifications, live updates, and more.

### 📦 **Serverless Deployment**

To ensure scalability and cost-effectiveness, we're setting our sights on serverless deployment. This will allow your applications to scale seamlessly, ensuring you only pay for the resources you use.

### 🐳 **Docker and Kubernetes Support**

We're bolstering our deployment capabilities by integrating Docker and Kubernetes support. This will simplify and streamline the process of deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

### 🗄️ **NoSQL Database Support**

In addition to SQL, we plan to extend our support to NoSQL databases like MongoDB. This will provide you with more flexible and scalable data storage solutions to meet diverse application needs.

This roadmap is a testament to our commitment to making Syrup the go-to framework for web development. Please note that these plans may evolve based on community feedback and changing technology landscapes.

We welcome contributions to help us realize this vision. If you're as excited about these features as we are and want to contribute, please feel free to submit pull requests or suggest new ideas. Let's brew the future of web development together with Syrup!
