# ToDo List

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

- [ ] Extend `show_descriptive_stats` to include skewness, kurtosis, and mode.
- [ ] Include visualizations such as boxplots to better represent the statistical properties.

## 2. Data Visualization

- [ ] Add methods for visualizing time series data, if relevant.
- [ ] Implement functionality to compare distributions across categories.

## 3. Correlation Analysis

- [ ] Enhance `show_correlation_matrix` method to better highlight strong correlations.
- [ ] Add functionality to measure correlations for non-linear and categorical relationships.

## 4. Categorical Feature Exploration

- [ ] Extend `explore_categorical` method to show proportion of categories.
- [ ] Implement method to show relationship between categorical features and target variable.

## 5. Missing Values

- [ ] Implement more sophisticated missing value imputation methods.
- [ ] Add support for visualizing missing data patterns.

## 6. Outliers Detection

- [ ] Implement different outlier detection methods (Z-score, DBSCAN, etc).
- [ ] Include functionality for outlier treatment.

## 7. Feature Engineering

- [ ] Add methods to automatically derive new features.
- [ ] Implement support for binning of continuous variables.

## 8. Data Transformation

- [ ] Include methods to handle skewed features (log transformation, square root, etc).
- [ ] Add support for encoding categorical features.

## 9. Robustness

- [ ] Handle potential exceptions and errors.
- [ ] Add checks for the correct input types and values.

## 10. Efficiency

- [ ] Optimize for large datasets.
- [ ] Consider implementing some methods in a more efficient way if possible.

## 11. Code Quality

- [ ] Add docstrings and comments for all methods.
- [ ] Ensure PEP 8 compliance for better readability and maintainability.

## 12. Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for all methods.

## 13. Documentation

- [ ] Provide a comprehensive README with usage examples.
- [ ] Include visualizations in the documentation.

## 14. Additional Features

- [ ] Add methods for text data exploration if relevant.
- [ ] Implement feature importance estimation methods.
