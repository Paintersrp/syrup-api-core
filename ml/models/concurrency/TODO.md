# TODO for ResourceMonitor Model

## Optimization

- [ ] Evaluate the current model architecture for overfitting and underfitting.
- [ ] Explore more advanced optimization algorithms other than Adam. Consider using RMSprop, Adagrad, Adamax, or Nadam.
- [ ] Experiment with different batch sizes and epoch numbers. A smaller batch size may lead to better generalization, while more epochs might help the model to converge.
- [ ] Explore regularization methods (like dropout or L1/L2 regularization) to prevent overfitting.
- [ ] Integrate learning rate schedulers to change the learning rate dynamically during training.

## Improvements

- [ ] Implement data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's robustness and generalizability.
- [ ] Use a more sophisticated normalization method for features, such as StandardScaler or RobustScaler.
- [ ] Add a functionality to handle missing values in the dataset.
- [ ] Experiment with more complex model architectures, like adding more LSTM layers, changing the number of units in layers, or even trying out GRU layers.

## Functionality

- [ ] Add support for multi-step predictions. The current model is set up for one-step predictions.
- [ ] Implement model checkpointing to save the model weights after each epoch or when there is an improvement.
- [ ] Add functionality to allow the model to continue training from the last checkpoint. This can be helpful for long training processes.
- [ ] Implement early stopping to stop the training when the validation loss is not improving anymore.
- [ ] Implement a method to plot the model's loss curve for better visualization of the training and validation process.

## Other Enhancements

- [ ] Consider integrating TFX (TensorFlow Extended) or MLFlow for end-to-end ML pipeline (data validation, preprocessing, model training, model validation, and serving).
- [ ] Investigate the model's performance on different evaluation metrics (like MAE, RMSE) beyond the current loss function (MSE).
- [ ] Implement a method for hyperparameter tuning, such as GridSearch or RandomizedSearch, to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model.
- [ ] Incorporate unit tests and end-to-end tests for the model to ensure everything is working as expected when changes are made.
- [ ] Integrate logging and error handling for better debugging and tracking.

## Deployment

- [ ] Look into converting the model to ONNX format for better interoperability and to use across different platforms.
- [ ] Explore serving the model in a web application using TensorFlow.js, Flask, or Django.
- [ ] Consider deploying the model on a cloud platform like Google Cloud AI Platform, AWS Sagemaker, or Azure ML for scalability.

Remember to keep track of your changes and improvements for reproducibility and versioning.
