# Anomaly Detector To-Do List

## General

- [ ] Review class and method docstrings for clarity and completeness.

## Functionality

- [ ] Implement option to choose between different types of models (e.g., LSTM, GRU, Autoencoder) for anomaly detection.
- [ ] Consider implementing functionality to handle sequences of variable length.
- [ ] Add support for multivariate anomaly detection.
- [ ] Implement functionality for real-time anomaly detection.

## Optimization

- [ ] Implement grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning of the neural network model.
- [ ] Consider using other optimization algorithms, apart from 'adam'.
- [ ] Experiment with different activation functions.
- [ ] Try implementing regularization techniques (L1, L2, Dropout) to avoid overfitting.
- [ ] Test the effect of different batch sizes on the training process.

## Error Handling and Validation

- [ ] Add error handling for incorrect input types and values.
- [ ] Implement more rigorous validation checks for input data.
- [ ] Consider using a more robust method for calculating the threshold (e.g., based on statistical properties of the error distribution).

## Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for all methods.
- [ ] Create integration tests to ensure correct interaction between methods.

## Documentation

- [ ] Write usage examples for all public methods.
- [ ] Create a tutorial on how to use the `AnomalyDetector` class with real-world data.
- [ ] Update the README.md file with new features and examples.

## Performance

- [ ] Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Test the performance of the model on large datasets.
- [ ] Implement functionality for parallel training of the model.

## Code Quality

- [ ] Refactor `train` method to reduce complexity.
- [ ] Use Python's logging library for verbose output instead of print statements.
- [ ] Check the code against PEP8 style guide and fix any discrepancies.

## Features

- [ ] Add functionality to save the anomaly detection results to a file.
- [ ] Add support for visualizing the error distribution and the anomaly detection results.
- [ ] Implement functionality for incremental learning.
